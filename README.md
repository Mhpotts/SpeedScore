### Retrospective

No link. We ran our retrospective meeting in-person.

#### What went well
  - We're very good at communicating with each other.
  - We work as a team very well and help each other out whenever we can.

 #### What we'd like to improve
  - We need to be a bit more careful with merge conflicts.
  - Spread out the work a bit more (because most of the work was based off IA8)

#### Changes we plan to implement in next milestone period
  - Editing could be more optimized but not much we would need to improve on at the moment.

#### Retrospective meeting notes (as well as meetiing with Dr. H)

General Notes from 2021-11-17 Checkup Meeting
- Report is filling in the README template
- Copy over new template README file (?)
- Report's purpose is to gather statistics to help all parties understand what was done for the milestone
    - Gets 3 story points for completing README
- No continuous integration testing required, animated GIF files for the testing like previous assignments
- Canvas says TPM 1 is due December 5th, actually due following week with demo
- TPM 2 is due during class' final period 

## Milestone 1 (Due 12/3)

### Retrospective

No recording but here are the notes we took during the meeting:

```
Kristian wants to finish reviews:
- Wants it to be like the edit page where you click a button on a row/table and brings you to a modal.
--- Similar to above but it brings you to another table
--- Put another button on each of the different course entries

Badge system:
- Eli
- Aaron
- Kristian
--- Works on rounds and feed mode
--- Feed page already has the hook complete
Frontend
    Rounds Page
        Earn badges link that sends you to Badges Info Page
        Create a toast for unlocking a badge
    Feed Page
        User entry example with badge icons and mouseover info
    Badges Info
        Users can earn badges based on the number of rounds they play (10, 20, 30, etc.)
         Users can earn badges based on their round time
         Users can earn badges based on their golf strokes
         Users can earn badges for frequency of play or streaks


Backend
    App Component
        App component logic functions, these are passed down to Rounds, and to view/edit modal
    Server Routes
        User
            Update to hold array of boolean values for badges owned
